	abstract = {Conservation science is a rapidly developing discipline, and the knowledge base it generates is relevant for practical applications. It is therefore crucial to monitor biases and trends in conservation literature, to track the progress of the discipline and re-align efforts where needed. We evaluated past and present trends in the focus of the conservation literature, and how they relate to conservation needs. We defined the focus of the past literature from 13 published reviews referring to 18,369 article classifications, and the focus of the current literature by analysing 2553 articles published between 2011–2015. We found that some of the historically under-studied biodiversity elements are receiving significantly more attention today, despite being still under-represented. The total proportion of articles on invertebrates, genetic diversity, or aquatic systems is 50\%–60\% higher today than it was before 2010. However, a disconnect between scientific focus and conservation needs is still present, with greater attention devoted to areas or taxa less rich in biodiversity and threatened biodiversity. In particular, a strong geographical bias persists, with 40\% of studies carried out in USA, Australia or the UK, and only 10\% and 6\% respectively in Africa or South East Asia. Despite some changing trends, global conservation science is still poorly aligned with biodiversity distribution and conservation priorities, especially in relation to threatened species. To overcome the biases identified here, scientists, funding agencies and journals must prioritise research adaptively, based on biodiversity conservation needs. Conservation depends on policy makers and practitioners for success, and scientists should actively provide those who make decisions with the knowledge that best addresses their needs.},

The ﬁrst global assessment of an insect order (Odonata) provides new context to the ongoing discussion of current biodiversity loss. A randomly selected sample of 1500 (26.4\%) of the 5680 described dragonﬂies and damselﬂies was assessed using IUCN’s Red List criteria. Distribution maps for each species were created and species were assigned to habitat types. These data were analysed in respect to threat level for regions and habitat types. We have found that one in 10 species of dragonﬂies and damselﬂies is threatened with extinction. This threat level is among the lowest of groups that have been assessed to date, suggesting that previous estimates of extinction risk for insects might be misleading. However, Odonata only comprise a small invertebrate order, with above-average dispersal ability and relatively wide distribution ranges. For conservation science and policy to be truly representative of global biodiversity a representative cross-section of invertebrates needs to be included.},

Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases.

For many of these species, targets for recovery specify the number of populations that should exist by a specific future date but offer no procedure to plan strategically to achieve the target for any species. 2. Here we describe techniques based upon geographic information systems (GIS) that produce conservation strategy maps (CSM) to assist with achieving recovery targets based on all available and relevant information. 3. The heath fritillary Mellicta athalia is a UKBAP species used here to illustrate the use of CSM. A phase 1 habitat survey was used to identify habitat polygons across the county of Kent, UK. These were systematically filtered using relevant habitat, botanical and autecological data to identify seven types of polygon, including those with extant colonies or in the vicinity of extant colonies, areas managed for conservation but without colonies, and polygons that had the appropriate habitat structure and may therefore be suitable for reintroduction. 4. Five clusters of polygons of interest were found across the study area. The CSM of two of them are illustrated here: the Blean Wood complex, which contains the existing colonies of heath fritillary in Kent, and the Orlestone Forest complex, which offers opportunities for reintroduction. 5. Synthesis and applications. Although the CSM concept is illustrated here for the UK, we suggest that CSM could be part of species conservation programmes throughout the world. CSM are dynamic and should be stored in electronic format, preferably on the world-wide web, so that they can be easily viewed and updated. CSM can be used to illustrate opportunities and to develop strategies with scientists and non-scientists, enabling the engagement of all communities in a conservation programme. CSM for different years can be presented to illustrate the progress of a plan or to provide continuous feedback on how a field scenario develops.},

In fact, they have been crucial to the advancement of our understanding of insect ecology and evolution. This book provides a critical summary of the major advances in these fields. Contributions from many of the leading researchers in dragonfly biology offer new perspectives and paradigms as well as additional, unpublished, data. The editor has carefully assembled a mix of theoretical and applied chapters (including those addressing conservation and monitoring) and achieves a balance of emerging and established research topics, providing suggestions for future study in each case. This accessible text is not about dragonflies per se but an essential source of knowledge that describes how different sets of evolutionary and ecological principles/ideas have been tested on a particular taxon. It will therefore be suitable for graduate students and researchers in entomology, evolutionary biology, population and behavioural ecology, and conservation biology. It will of course be of particular interest and use to those working on insects and an indispensable reference text for odonate biologists.},

	abstract = {Biological records are one of the most important sources of data for a large number of research areas. For example, their application has made valuable contributions to climate change ecology, where they are used to monitor species range shifts; to conservation ecology, where they are used to assess species' Red List status; and to biogeography, where they are used to highlight hotspots of biodiversity. A major benefit of biological records is the large spatial extent of the coverage combined with the fine spatial precision of the data: this combination is essential for any ecologist hoping to address large-scale questions about biodiversity and environmental change. Because most biological records are collected by a vast pool of volunteer recorders, studies utilizing biological records have the advantage of large-scale long-term data that it would otherwise be unfeasibly expensive to collect. We review the application of biological records by focussing on four key areas of biodiversity research: biogeography, trend assessments, climate change ecology, and conservation biology. We showcase the diversity of insights that biological records have delivered, which in turn illustrates the contribution of the voluntary recording community to our understanding of biodiversity science. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, ●●, ●●–●●.},

	abstract = {Capture–recapture software packages have proven to be very powerful tools for analysing factors affecting survival in wild populations. However, all such packages are limited to discrete-time protocols. Appropriate survival analysis tools are still lacking for data acquired from continuous-time protocols. We have developed a statistical method and propose an r package for analysing such data based on an extension of classical survival analysis models incorporating an inhomogeneous Poisson process for modelling capture histories. First, data were simulated from a continuous-time protocol. These data were used to (i) compare survival estimation biases of discrete- and continuous-time approaches and (ii) investigate the performance and accuracy of our r package for four types of covariates: factors varying between individuals (like sex), in time (like climatic factors), both in time and between individuals (like physical condition) and age (as a categorical factor). Secondly, the r package has been applied to a real data set for survival analysis of cats in the Kerguelen archipelago (regrouping 682 cats over 20 years) as an illustrative example. Results of the simulated data analysis show that the method performs better than its discrete-time counterpart for analysing data acquired from continuous-time protocols. It provides unbiased parameter estimates for all parameters except those that vary both in time and between individuals – which is not surprising, since in our case, these factors were not updated in continuous time (i.e. only upon capture). When applied to the Kerguelen cat data set, the results suggest that survival is lower in juveniles than in adults and subadults, varies between study sites and increases with physical condition, and this latter effect being more important in females than in males. Sex, season, temporal linear trend in survival and the NDVI vegetation index were also tested but were not found to be significant. However, confidence intervals were too large (due to a low recapture rate) for excluding such effects. Further analyses are still needed for rigorous covariate testing in this context. In conclusion, continuous-time approaches – such as that presented in this paper – should be preferred when data acquired from continuous-time protocols is analysed.},

	abstract = {Conservation translocations (including reintroductions) are potentially powerful tools for wildlife conservation, and their use has increased worldwide. However, most studies have focused on vertebrates, with the long-term impact and ecological progress of translocations being neglected. Moreover, such projects rarely target insects. The present study reports the long-term persistence of a population of Leucorrhinia dubia (Odonata: Libellulidae) reintroduced to artificially created bog pools in the Czech Republic. Eighty (pen)ultimate instar L. dubia larvae were translocated in 2001, and the dragonfly assemblage at the reintroduction site was monitored for 15years following larvae release. In 2015–2017, the capture-mark-recapture method, the Jolly-Seber model, and exuviae collection were used to evaluate the demography of the translocated population. Microsatellite analysis was performed to assess the genetic variability of source and reintroduced populations. Over the monitored period, population size increased (80 larvae released vs. 108–115 exuviae and 75 adults at the end of the study) and L. dubia became a dominant species, whereas the composition and abundance of the local dragonfly assemblage were not substantially changed. These results indicate that reintroductions are effective measures for dragonfly conservation, as translocating a relatively small number of individuals led to the establishment of a self-sustaining population. Using (pen)ultimate instar larvae was optimal for dragonfly translocation, but the availability of a high-quality habitat and the active collaboration with nature conservation authorities were vital for the successful outcome. Genetic analysis suggested that the translocated population might serve as a source of genetic variation for the original population, if depleted.},
